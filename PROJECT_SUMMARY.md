🔬 SYNTHETIC TIME-SERIES DATA GENERATION PROJECT
==================================================

COMPLETED STEPS:
  ✅ Data exploration and preprocessing

📊 KEY METRICS:
  Run evaluation pipeline to generate metrics

📁 OUTPUT FILES:
  data/X_augmented.npy - Augmented dataset (real + synthetic)
  results/synthetic_class_*.npy - Class-specific synthetic data
  results/evaluation_report.txt - Comprehensive evaluation report
  models/conditional_timegan.pth - Trained TimeGAN model
  results/*.png - Visualization plots

🚀 NEXT STEPS:
  • Scale up training with GPU for better results
  • Experiment with different hyperparameters
  • Apply to other imbalanced time-series datasets
  • Implement privacy evaluation (membership inference)
